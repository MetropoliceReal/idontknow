# A clock
How to use: To run this script, save it in a file with a .lua extension (e.g., clock.lua) and then execute it using the Lua interpreter. The clock will display the current time updated every second. Note: The code uses the clear command to clear the console on Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS. If you are using Windows, you should replace clear with cls and sleep 1 with timeout /t 1.
